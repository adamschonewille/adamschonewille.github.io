# **Research Experience**

**Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V. – Laser Micromachining Group Hannover, Germany**<br/>
*Additive Manufacturing Research Position with Dr. Kotaro Obata and Arndt Hohnholz,*<br/>  
*May 2016 – Dec. 2016*<br/>
**About:** Laser Zentrum Hannover is a research institute supported by the Lower Saxony Ministry for Economics, Labour and Transport, and is devoted to the selfless promotion of applied research in the field of laser technology and optics.<br/>

**• Independent Research:** Conducted various experiments in additive manufacturing with new materials. Gained experience with
PDMS and micro-fluidics as well as micro-stereolithography with unique polymers and acrylates.<br/>
**• Academic Publications:** Wrote and edited papers based on findings. Co-author on two manuscripts.<br/>
**• Safety Training:** Trained for Laser Safety as working environment included optics and hazardous lasers. Trained and worked with
toxic and combustible chemicals.<br/>

**University of British Columbia – Department of Chemistry and Physics Vancouver, Canada**<br/>
*Technical Undergraduate Research Assistant for Dr. Takamasa Momose,*<br/>  
*Jan. 2015 - Apr. 2015*<br/>
**About:** Worked in Dr. Takamasa Momose’s lab conducting research on the physics and chemistry of extremely cold molecules and
atoms. The lab contains various operational apparatuses including Zeeman and Stark decelerators, counter rotating nozzles, and a
parahydrogen matrix system for making cold and ultracold molecules.<br/>

**• Machining Experience:** Utilized lathes, milling machines, drill press, power tools, hand tools, a waterjet cutter and laser cutter to
quickly create working prototypes for use in the lab.<br/>
**• Data Acquisition and Analysis:** Workedwith several graduate students simultaneously, helping run multiple experiments. Performed
data acquisition and analysis through MATLAB simulations.<br/>
**• Research Assistant:** Presented several times to colleagues as part of scheduled weekly meetings. Received acknowledgement for
my work in the lab in both a PhD thesis and published paper.<br/>
