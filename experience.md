# **Work Experience**

## Drone Logics Ltd.<br/>
### **Robotics Engineer/Drone Technician**<br/>
*Burnaby, Canada.     June 2018 – Aug. 2018*<br/>
**• Robotic Arms:** Fixed several controllability issues in software and in electrical design on two robotic arm prototypes. These robot
arms have 1 and 2 degrees of freedom mount to chase cars for filming applications where their payload is a camera gimbal.<br/>
**• Electrical Circuit Design:** Designed and built circuits for DC high voltage and current power switching, RFID wireless communication, brushed and brushless DC motor speed control, signal wiring, and micro-controller processing (Arduino).<br/>
**• Software Development:** Developed the software in C/Arduino to control the pan and tilt motions of the robotic arms, included implementing safety features and fail-safes.<br/>
**• Commercial Production and Manufacturing:** Collaborated to develop controller prototypes (electrical components, packaging and enclosures) as well as plans for future mass production of designed controllers.<br/>
**• Documentation:** Kept a detailed report of engineering work and notes on how the system functions for the next person the project is passed onto.<br/>
**• Troubleshooting and Repairs:** Aided in the diagnosis and repair of several commercially available drones for multiple clients.<br/><br/>

## University of British Columbia – Faculty of Applied Science<br/>
### **Robotics Teaching Assistant**<br/>
*Vancouver, Canada.     May 2018 – Aug. 2018*<br/>
**About:** The ENPH 253 summer course is a rigorous 4 month course where students design, fabricate, and test prototype autonomous robots to compete against their peers in a competition at a end of course. Students design and build their own motor controller circuits, filters, IR detection circuits, power distribution circuits, as well as constructing everything from the robots chassis to wheels and appendages. Students have access to a variety of tools and materials, utilizing a water jet cutter, laser cutter, 3D printers, drill press, mills, lathe, and power tools to build their robots.<br/>

**• Troubleshooting:** Helped students debug their circuits when they broke or worked unexpectedly. Provided guidance in electrical changes and improvements. Analyzed student’s code to help fix electrical problems. Showed students the microcontroller electrical schematics to show them how to solve their problems.<br/>
**• Mechatronics projects:** Miscellaneous projects the instructor outsourced to me. These included making IR beacons, a RFID tag door opener, and the electronics of the competition surface.<br/>
**• Teaching and Advising:** Commented on students mechanical designs and provided insight. Helped students brainstorm solutions to their mechanical design problems. Provided suggestions to electrical circuit design to reduce noise and enhance performance.<br/>

## NORAM Engineering and Constructors Ltd. – Electrochemical Group<br/>
### **Mechanical Engineer Co-op**<br/>
*Vancouver, Canada.     May 2017 – Aug. 2017*<br/>
**About:** NORAM is a Vancouver-based company that develops, engineers, and commercializes technologies and equipment packages for the chemical, pulp and paper, minerals processing and electrochemical sectors. They also work with early-stage technology companies providing engineering design and fabrication support, as well as giving advice in technology commercialization.<br/>
**• Mechanical Design:** Worked within the Electrochemical group as a mechanical engineer co-op. Gained practical experience in mechanical design, SolidWorks modeling, prototyping, piping, structural mechanics, fluid dynamics and heat transfer.<br/>
**• Commercial Production:** Helped to design and build the infrastructure necessary for assembly production of commercial cells to build a commercial plant. Contributed substantial work a multi-million dollar project.<br/>
**• Documentation:** Wrote reports to send to clients, documented prototype progress, and kept a detailed logbook of research and
development experiments.<br/>

# **Research Experience**

## University of Toronto – Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering<br/>
### **Microrobotics Graduate Research Position with Dr. Eric Diller,**<br/>
*Toronto, Canada.     Sept. 2018 – present*<br/>
<br/>

## Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V. – Laser Micromachining Group<br/>
### **Additive Manufacturing Research Position with Dr. Kotaro Obata and Arndt Hohnholz,**<br/>
*Hannover, Germany.     May 2016 – Dec. 2016*<br/>
**About:** Laser Zentrum Hannover is a research institute supported by the Lower Saxony Ministry for Economics, Labour and Transport, and is devoted to the selfless promotion of applied research in the field of laser technology and optics.<br/>

**• Independent Research:** Conducted various experiments in additive manufacturing with new materials. Gained experience with
PDMS and micro-fluidics as well as micro-stereolithography with unique polymers and acrylates.<br/>
**• Academic Publications:** Wrote and edited papers based on findings. Co-author on two manuscripts.<br/>
**• Safety Training:** Trained for Laser Safety as working environment included optics and hazardous lasers. Trained and worked with
toxic and combustible chemicals.<br/><br/>

## University of British Columbia – Department of Chemistry and Physics<br/>
### **Technical Undergraduate Research Assistant for Dr. Takamasa Momose,**<br/>
*Vancouver, Canada.     Jan. 2015 - Apr. 2015*<br/>
**About:** Worked in Dr. Takamasa Momose’s lab conducting research on the physics and chemistry of extremely cold molecules and
atoms. The lab contains various operational apparatuses including Zeeman and Stark decelerators, counter rotating nozzles, and a
parahydrogen matrix system for making cold and ultracold molecules.<br/>

**• Machining Experience:** Utilized lathes, milling machines, drill press, power tools, hand tools, a waterjet cutter and laser cutter to
quickly create working prototypes for use in the lab.<br/>
**• Data Acquisition and Analysis:** Workedwith several graduate students simultaneously, helping run multiple experiments. Performed
data acquisition and analysis through MATLAB simulations.<br/>
**• Research Assistant:** Presented several times to colleagues as part of scheduled weekly meetings. Received acknowledgement for
my work in the lab in both a PhD thesis and published paper.<br/><br/>
