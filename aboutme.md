Hi! I am a Robotics and Mechatronics Engineer who recently received their MASc in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Toronto after receiving my BASc in Engineering Physics from the University of British Columbia. During my masterâ€™s program, I developed a mechatronic system responsible for wirelessly controlling microsurgical tools targeting neurosurgical applications.

When I am not tinkering with robotics, I enjoy going on hikes, bouldering, and gardening.
